## llama3.c - A faithful clone of Karpathy's llama2.c but fully functional with LLaMA 3 8B base and instruct models.

Have you ever wanted to inference a baby [Llama 3](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) model in pure C? No? Well, now you can!

Run LLaMA 3 8B models with one simple 700-line C file ([run.c](run.c)). 

The current code only inferences models in fp32, so you will most likely not be able to productively load models larger than 8B.

Please note that this repo is a modificaion of Andrej Karpathy's llama2.c but changing the hard coding to work with the modified-tiktoken tokenization used by the suite of Meta LLaMA 3 models.

## getting started

First, navigate to the folder where you keep your projects and clone this repository to this folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jameswdelancey/llama3.c.git
```

Then, open the repository folder:

```bash
cd llama3.c
```

Download LLaMA 3 8B base and/or instruct. The huggingface site works. You'll need to sign up and get approved.
Specifically download the `original` directory.

# compile and run the C code:

```bash
make run
./run.exe "llama3_8b_instruct.bin" -z "tokenizer_llama3.bin" -m chat
./run.exe "llama3_8b_instruct.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin" -i "Once upon a time"
```

# high performance

- fopenmp If you have these libraries you can run the model much faster. I'm running an Intel i3 14th gen and get 1.9 tok/s with openmp
- march=native This is required for gcc or clang to use SIMD intrinsics and will speed up your runs.
- win.c This is optional unless you're on Windows. I'm compiling with MINGW64 and it works well.
- gcc or clang, both work well and I get very close results between the two.

```bash
$ gcc -Ofast -fopenmp -march=native run.c win.c -o run
```

# base model single shot
This still runs at interactive rates and samples more coherent and diverse stories:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_base.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin" -n 50 -i "Once upon a time"
```

> Once upon a time, a girl named Lily who had grown up in a world where people werenΓÇÖt allowed to live happily ever after. One day, Lily decided to take a chance and do something that was a little bit crazy, something that she had

You can also prompt the model with a prefix or a number of additional command line arguments, e.g. to sample at temperature 0.8 for 256 steps and with a prompt:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_base.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin" -t 0.8 -n 256 -i "One day, Lily met a Shoggoth"
```

> One day, Lily met a Shoggoth named Lurking. She had never seen a Shoggoth before, but she was immediately impressed by its size and ferocity. They struck up a conversation, and Lurking told her about the ShoggothsΓÇÖ origins and their place in the universe. Lily was fascinated by what Lurking told her, and she learned a lot about the Shoggoths that day. She also made a new friend in Lurking.

# instruct model, chat

You're very likely to get results that you like better from the instruct model. You must use it with the chat mode as the token setup (preamble) is totally different. Here's an example:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_instruct.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin" -m chat
```

## Meta's Llama 3 models

Sadly there is a bit of friction here due to licensing (I can't directly upload the checkpoints, I think). So Step 1, get the Llama 3 checkpoints by following the [Meta instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama3). Once we have those checkpoints, we have to convert them into the llama3.c format.
For this we need to install the python dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and then use the `export.py` file, e.g. for 8B model:

```bash
python export.py llama3_8b_base.bin --meta-llama ../llama3-8b-base/
```

The export will take ~10 minutes or so and generate a 31GB file (the weights of the 8B model in float32) called `llama3_8b.bin` in the current directory. Once the export is done, we can run it:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_base.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin"
```

This ran at about 2 tokens/s compiled with [OpenMP](#OpenMP) on 8 threads on my Intel i3 14th gen. Example output:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_base.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin"
```
> Question:
> What is the second derivative of 2*p**3 - 4*p**2 - 12*p?
> Answer:
> 12*p - 8

base models... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Since we can inference the base model, it should be possible to also inference the instruct model quite easily, and have a conversation with it. And if we can find a way to run 7B more efficiently, we can start adding LoRA to our training script, and going wild with finetunes all within the repo!

You can also chat with the Llama Chat models. Export the chat model exactly as above:

```bash
python export.py llama3_8b_instruct.bin --meta-llama ../llama3-8b-instruct/
```

Then chat with it by specifying the chat mode using the `-m` flag, e.g.:

```bash
./run "llama3_8b_instruct.bin" -z "../dev/tokenizer_llama3.bin" -m chat
```
